## Introduction and Disclaimer

This article is a bit different from my previous onesâ€”it's not a technical deep dive but rather a community-focused piece where I'd like to introduce some of the tools I use daily as a consultant. Most of these tools are community-driven or managed by individuals on GitHub. While there are exceptions, I won't include commercial tools that are paid and lack community versions.

There are areas and tools I'll cover more thoroughly in future posts, but the main goal of this blog entry is to present them in a basic way and show you their purpose. I'll also include "multi-link" entriesâ€”that is, collections of toolsâ€”as long as they are hosted on GitHub.

I've decided to separate the categories into **IAM (Identity Access Management)**, **UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) & Modern Work (M365 and related services)**, and **Azure & Microsoft**. The reason is purely organizational, so those looking for IAM or UEM tools don't have to sift through Azure tools and vice versa.

I haven't included blogs because the list would be infinite ðŸ˜…, but if you want a list of some blogs I follow, most can be found on this page: [https://azurecrazy.com/azure-blogs/](https://azurecrazy.com/azure-blogs/).

I'm not responsible for any errors in the tools or their functionalities. My goal with this post is to show you the tools I've used at some point (or even use daily) and have them centralized.

The contact persons (along with their LinkedIn links) are not necessarily responsible for these repositories; they are mainly the people who created or introduced me to these repositoriesâ€”that is, the people that I personally consider contributors. I'm sure I've forgotten to mention many of you; in that case, you can let me know, and I'll add the LinkedIn linksâ€”it's not a problem ðŸ˜Š.

I'll probably forget some tools, which I'll add over time, but if you want to add a tool that isn't listed (which I would greatly appreciate), you can do so via the following link: [Add Tool](https://github.com/schmittnieto/schmittnieto.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=add_tool.yml) or by sending an email to tools@schmitt-nieto.com with a brief description of the tool to add.

Regarding the order I've followed when organizing the repositories, I'll tell you in advance that it was totally random based on the order of my bookmarks ðŸ˜‚. If anyone needs to appear higher or lower, let me know, and I'll move it.

## IAM, UEM & Modern Work

In this section, I'll cover the tools I usually use when carrying out infrastructure inventories and implementing improvements in various areas (EntraID, Intune, Conditional Access, PIM...) and also include repositories related to Modern Work (M365).

- **ThomasKur/M365Documentation**
  - **GitHub**: [ThomasKur - M365Documentation](https://github.com/ThomasKur/M365Documentation)
  - **Type**: Automatic Microsoft 365 documentation to simplify the lives of admins and consultants.
  - **Last Update**: ![Commits](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ThomasKur/M365Documentation?style=plastic)
  - **Note**: This is a comprehensive tool that uses GraphAPI to create documentation of the current state of the following elements: Intune, EntraID (Conditional Access...), CloudPrint, Information Protection, and Windows 365. Highly recommended when doing an inventory of the current state.
  - **LinkedIn**: [in/thomas-kurth-a86b7851](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kurth-a86b7851/)

- **microsoft/EntraExporter**
  - **GitHub**: [microsoft - EntraExporter](https://github.com/microsoft/EntraExporter)
  - **Type**: PowerShell module to export a local copy of an Entra (Azure AD) tenant configuration.
  - **Last Update**: ![Commits](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/microsoft/EntraExporter?style=plastic)
  - **Note**: In the past, I've made several configurations where, in Azure DevOps Pipelines, I exported the EntraID configuration. Remember, it's not a standard backup (since there's no EntraImporter ðŸ˜œ), but it helps a lot to get an idea of the state of the Entra tenant at a specific point in the past.
  - **LinkedIn**: [in/merill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merill/)

- **Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM**
  - **GitHub**: [Cloud-Architekt - AzurePrivilegedIAM](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM)

  - **Last Update**: ![Commits](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jasperbaes/Microsoft-Cloud-Group-Analyzer?style=plastic)
  - **Note**: I tried it in the past, but the fact that it's dependent on Node.js and not a PowerShell module means I don't use it as much as I should. Still, it's highly recommended to take a look.
  - **LinkedIn**: [in/jasper-baes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasper-baes/)
