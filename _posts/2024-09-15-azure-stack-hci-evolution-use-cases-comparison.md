# Introduction

Azure Stack HCI (Hyper-Converged Infrastructure) has emerged as a pivotal solution for businesses aiming to modernize their on-premises infrastructure while leveraging the benefits of cloud computing. In this blog post, we'll delve into the history and evolution of Azure Stack HCI, explore its use cases, and compare it with other leading solutions such as VMware vSAN, OpenStack, OpenShift, and Hyper-V. We'll also examine the differences between the 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2 versions of Azure Stack HCI.



# History of Azure Stack HCI

Azure Stack HCI originated from Microsoft's Hyper-V technology, a longstanding virtualization solution integrated with Windows Server. As organizations sought hybrid cloud solutions, Microsoft integrated Hyper-V with Azure, enabling businesses to extend their on-premises environments seamlessly into the cloud.

Azure Stack HCI is a natural evolution of Hyper-V, designed to offer hybrid cloud functionality by allowing users to manage their on-premises infrastructure directly from Azure. Today, Azure Stack HCI enables comprehensive system management, including hardware monitoring and lifecycle management—all through Azure—providing a unified experience for both cloud and on-premises environments.



# Evolution of Azure Stack HCI

Initially, Azure Stack HCI focused on virtualizing workloads and providing software-defined storage. Over time, it has evolved to include services from Azure's ecosystem. Now, it supports not only traditional workloads but also cloud-native services. Azure Stack HCI currently enables:

- **Infrastructure Services**: Virtual machines (VMs) and networking from Azure.
- **Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
- **Platform Services**: Azure Data Controller, SQL Managed Instances, PostgreSQL Managed Instances, and Machine Learning services.

These services allow organizations to run modern workloads and benefit from cloud innovation while still utilizing on-premises infrastructure.



# Use Cases for Azure Stack HCI

1. **Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Legacy Systems**

   Azure Stack HCI is an ideal solution for companies relying on legacy systems that are no longer supported. The platform includes Extended Security Updates (ESU) at no additional cost, allowing businesses to maintain critical security without incurring expensive licensing fees.

2. **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**

   Azure Stack HCI is the only current solution for deploying Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) on-premises. With AVD now in General Availability (GA) on 23H2, organizations can deploy secure and scalable virtual desktop environments locally, fully integrated with Azure services.

3. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

   Starting with version 23H2, deploying AKS on Azure Stack HCI has become simpler and more transparent. The improved AKS implementation minimizes complexity, allowing IT teams to focus on deploying applications rather than managing infrastructure. This enhanced experience makes it one of the easiest ways to run Kubernetes workloads on-premises.

4. **Workloads like Virtual Machines**

   Azure Stack HCI allows the native deployment of virtual machines from Azure, fully integrated with Azure Arc at no additional cost. This integration includes features such as Azure Updates, Azure Policies, and other Arc services, streamlining the management of on-premises workloads.

   Additionally, Azure Stack HCI supports Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition, which includes Hotpatching, allowing updates without frequent reboots. This feature greatly reduces downtime and increases system availability.



# Comparison of Azure Stack HCI Versions: 21H2, 22H2, and 23H2

## Azure Stack HCI 21H2

- **Support**: Azure Stack HCI 21H2 is no longer supported, having reached the end of its lifecycle.
- **Features**: This version was the foundational release but has since been surpassed by newer, more feature-rich versions.

## Azure Stack HCI 22H2

- **Stretch Cluster**: The Stretch Cluster feature was supported but only for an additional location, providing basic disaster recovery capabilities, though not as flexible as full multi-site clustering.
- **Deployment**: Deploying Azure Stack HCI 22H2 was largely manual, relying on PowerShell scripts, which made implementation complex and time-consuming.
- **AKS**: Deploying AKS in 22H2 was similarly complex, requiring multiple PowerShell scripts, making Kubernetes management cumbersome.
- **AVD**: Azure Virtual Desktop was available only in Preview during 22H2, limiting its usability in production environments.

## Azure Stack HCI 23H2

- **Cloud Deployment**: Azure Stack HCI 23H2 introduced a cloud-first deployment model, simplifying and standardizing the setup process across all deployments. This approach significantly reduces complexity compared to previous versions.
- **AVD**: Azure Virtual Desktop reached General Availability (GA) in 23H2, offering organizations a robust, scalable solution for on-premises VDI, fully integrated with Azure.
- **Enhanced Security**: The Supplemental Package, now included by default in 23H2, improves security by hardening the infrastructure with additional protections.
- **Improved VM Management**: Deploying and managing VMs from Azure has been greatly enhanced in 23H2, making it easier to manage workloads with a native Azure experience.
- **AKS Improvements**: AKS deployment is now more seamless and efficient in 23H2, reducing the need for manual scripting. This enhancement enables IT teams to focus more on deploying and managing applications rather than wrestling with infrastructure.
- **Networking and Storage**: 23H2 includes significant improvements in networking and storage management, further simplifying infrastructure administration.



# Version Support and Transition Considerations

While 23H2 offers a more streamlined and secure solution, 22H2 remains supported, particularly due to its inclusion of Stretch Cluster—a feature that is absent in 23H2. Additionally, the deployment model in 23H2 introduces more cloud dependencies, which has complicated the upgrade path for some organizations. These dependencies have yet to be fully addressed, making some businesses hesitant to transition from 22H2 to 23H2.



# Comparison with Other Solutions

Azure Stack HCI faces competition from other major players in the hyper-converged infrastructure space. Let's compare it with VMware vSAN, OpenStack, OpenShift, and Hyper-V:

## VMware vSAN

VMware vSAN is known for its strong disaster recovery capabilities, including support for Stretch Clustering across multiple data centers. However, VMware's complex licensing structure can lead to higher costs. In contrast, Azure Stack HCI includes features like Azure Arc, Extended Security Updates (ESU), and native VM deployment from Azure at no additional cost. Despite lacking full stretch clustering, Azure Stack HCI offers a cost-effective solution, especially for businesses already invested in the Azure ecosystem.

## OpenStack

OpenStack is a flexible, open-source solution that offers strong customization options. However, it often requires significant expertise to deploy and maintain. Azure Stack HCI offers seamless integration with Azure and a simplified management experience, making it more suitable for organizations looking for a hybrid cloud solution without the steep learning curve.

## OpenShift

OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based platform known for its strong container orchestration capabilities. While it excels at managing cloud-native workloads, Azure Stack HCI's integration with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and native Azure platform services makes it a more comprehensive hybrid solution, especially for organizations seeking to balance containers with traditional virtual machine workloads.

## Hyper-V

While Hyper-V remains a strong virtualization platform, it lacks the cloud-native integration found in Azure Stack HCI. Azure Stack HCI builds on Hyper-V's foundation, offering advanced capabilities like lifecycle management, Azure Arc integration, and cloud-first deployment. For organizations already using Hyper-V, Azure Stack HCI provides a natural and feature-rich upgrade path.



# Conclusion

Azure Stack HCI has evolved into a comprehensive solution that allows organizations to manage hybrid workloads, from legacy systems to modern cloud-native applications. With its robust feature set—including Extended Security Updates, Azure Virtual Desktop, AKS, and native Azure Arc integration—Azure Stack HCI provides a unified solution for businesses seeking to blend on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud.

While the 23H2 release sets new standards for cloud-first deployment and simplified management, organizations running 22H2 may find it challenging to upgrade due to the dependencies and lack of Stretch Cluster support in 23H2. For businesses deeply invested in Azure or those looking to streamline infrastructure management, Azure Stack HCI remains a compelling option, standing out from competitors like VMware vSAN, OpenStack, OpenShift, and Hyper-V.
