## Introduction

Hello everyone, another year has gone by. As I did last year, I’ve set myself the goal of writing down a list of objectives for 2026, along with the main events that took place during 2025. This blog post is a bit more personal and less technical than usual, and its main purpose is to track the progress of my blog as well as my personal goals.

I want to be able to come back here next December and clearly see what I’ve managed to move forward and what I didn’t quite achieve, since my focus tends to change quite a bit throughout the year 😅

## 2025 Recap

### Personal Highlights

When I look back at my photo albums, I realize just how much has happened over the year. 2025 has been a great year, at least when it comes to personal and family goals. I’ve truly enjoyed spending time with my loved ones, and I’ve gained a much healthier perspective on how I approach life.

On the professional side, I’ve also continued to grow and evolve, and you’ll see a couple of articles about that during 2026 😜. Even though I didn’t manage to achieve some of the goals I set at the beginning of last year, like attending Ignite, I did attend several conferences and surrounded myself with some truly amazing people in the professional space, not all of them coworkers, which also led to making a few new friends along the way 🤗

### Professional Achievements

I wrapped up 2024 and started 2025 by earning Microsoft certifications in the areas I focused on the most throughout the year, namely Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator and Endpoint Administrator. During 2025, I was heavily focused on strengthening my overall knowledge and further developing my expertise around AVD, both in cloud and hybrid environments, with all the related challenges that come with them.

That said, this didn’t stop me from continuing to write and dedicating my free time to one of my favorite hobbies: Azure Local. In 2025, I published eight blog posts focused exclusively on Azure Local and solutions built for or around it. While I initially planned to write more about other topics, the way I approach each article, in terms of quality and the time invested, made it harder to branch out as much as I intended.

This time, I won’t include a list of articles like I did last year, nor a list of books I’m reading or have finished. This year, that list would be way too long, over 30 new books, and yes, I did finish the ones from last year as well. If anyone is curious about what I’m reading, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn and I’ll happily share the list 😜

### Blog Stats for 2025

Overall, blog statistics have improved this year, even though I slowed down a bit in the second half in terms of posting frequency. Since this is the first year where I have a full set of statistics, it’s honestly great to see how well the blog is being received, especially considering it focuses on a very niche topic, currently almost exclusively Azure Local.

As usual, the main statistics are split across Google Analytics, Google Search Console, Clarity, Bing, LinkedIn and this year I’m also adding my GitHub Rewind.

Overall, the growth this year has been quite positive, both in terms of community engagement and content. It’s true that I should have, and wanted to, publish more blog posts, but work commitments and family time took priority, which led me to put the blog slightly on hold during the second half of the year. This is clearly reflected in the statistics.

## Goals for 2026

This year, I’m setting goals that are less focused on technology and the blog itself:

- Don’t start smoking again (I relapsed in 2025 😅)
- Go to the gym more regularly
- Improve my Chinese (I started studying it last year)
- Further reduce mobile phone usage and aim for less than one hour per day
- Publish one blog post per month

As always, I wrap up the year by thanking everyone who has been by my side, and especially my wife and my daughter ♥️  

I wish you all a happy 2026!
