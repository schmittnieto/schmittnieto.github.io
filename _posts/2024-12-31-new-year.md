## Introduction

Making a list of milestones and goals isn‚Äôt usually my favorite activity, but let‚Äôs face it, writing things down makes them real. So here I am, summing up my 2024 and putting my 2025 goals into words. Let‚Äôs see where this reflection takes us!

## 2024 Recap

### Personal Highlights

2024 was special for one big reason: my daughter learned to walk! ü§ó Watching her take her first steps was by far the best moment of the year, and nothing else in this article will top that.

This year also marked the true start of this blog. Inspired by a conversation with [Patrick K√∂hler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-koehler/) at [AVD Techfest](https://avdtechfest.com/) on September 24, 2024, I decided to put more effort into writing and sharing. Although the blog existed before, Patrick gave me the push I needed to dive in.

Lastly, a change in my work environment made me see life in a new light. I‚Äôve become more ambitious professionally, striving for excellence while staying grounded and nurturing both old and new connections.

### Professional Achievements

Mid-year, I switched employers and joined an international team with a focus on Azure Local and AVD, two areas I‚Äôm deeply passionate about. This move has been a major highlight for me, professionally and personally. It allowed me to immerse myself in familiar fields like Intune while also opening doors to new challenges and opportunities.

The shift to remote work was another game-changer, offering me a better work-life balance and giving me more time to be present for my family. Professionally, it meant more time to dive deep into complex topics, network with global experts, and contribute to vibrant communities.

Community engagement has been another highlight of 2024. Here are some communities where I‚Äôve been active (and you should join too üòú):

- **[Azure Local Slack Channel](https://aka.ms/azurelocal-slack):** I‚Äôve contributed where I could and built great relationships with OEMs and peers.
- **[Microsoft Customer Connection Program (MCCP)](https://aka.ms/joinccp):** A unique program where Microsoft gathers feedback from customers under NDA to shape product roadmaps.
- **GitHub Contributions:** I created the [AzSHCI repository](https://github.com/schmittnieto/AzSHCI) for simplified Azure Local deployments with PowerShell and compiled a [list of essential tools](https://schmitt-nieto.com/blog/github-tools/) for IT consultants.

#### Books I‚Äôve Read (or Am Reading)

Thanks to my new Kindle Scribe, reading these Packt books has been a breeze!

### Blog Stats for 2024

I launched this blog earlier this year, with my first post published on July 11. Since then, I‚Äôve implemented tools like Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity to track engagement and even added a cookie banner for compliance.

#### Google Analytics

Launched on September 5, Analytics helps me track traffic and its sources.

#### Google Search Console

Registered the blog on August 2, and here‚Äôs the data so far.

#### Clarity

Added on October 8, Clarity has become my primary tool for analyzing user behavior thanks to its ad-blocker-proof data.

#### Bing Webmaster Tools

#### LinkedIn

LinkedIn has been a game-changer for me this year. I started with around 400 followers in January and ended the year with over 1,500, a growth driven by posting consistently and sharing meaningful content.

I shifted my focus to sharing personal milestones, insights from my projects, and articles I found valuable, including posts from my blog and contributions from peers. This approach not only increased engagement but also sparked insightful conversations with industry experts and fellow professionals.

Beyond posting, actively engaging with others, commenting, sharing feedback, and celebrating their successes, helped me strengthen my network and create lasting connections. LinkedIn remains my go-to platform for learning, sharing, and growing in the tech community.

## Goals for 2025

Writing goals makes them feel achievable, so here are mine for the upcoming year:

- Master **Terraform**, **Bicep** and **GraphAPI**.
- Launch AVD/W365/Intune series on the blog, with an average of two posts per month.
- Finish my pending books.
- Improve my spoken English.
- Create a GitHub tool for the AVD/W365/Intune community.
- Reduce daily phone usage from 4 hours to 2 by using alternative devices for audiobooks and cutting back on social media.
- Attend **Microsoft Ignite**.
- Speak at a conference.
- Spend as much time as possible with my wife and daughter. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to everyone in my professional and personal life, colleagues, friends, family, and especially my wife for her patience with my late-night writing sessions and quirky ideas. ü§ó

Here‚Äôs to an even better 2025!
