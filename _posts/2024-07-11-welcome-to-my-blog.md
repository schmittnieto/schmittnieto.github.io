# Why I Started This Blog

Hello, I'm **Cristian Schmitt Nieto**, and welcome to my blog! As an Azure consultant with over a decade of experience in IT, I wanted to create a space to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights. This blog is a reflection of my passion for technology and my journey from managing small data centers to diving deep into the world of Azure.

## My Journey

Starting as an IT enthusiast in Spain, my career took me to Germany, where I managed data center infrastructures and explored various technologies. Over the years, my fascination with cloud computing led me to specialize in Azure. I've had the opportunity to work on hybrid infrastructures, Azure Virtual Desktop, and various DevOps practices, which has enriched my professional journey.

## Purpose of This Blog

The main goal of this blog is to share my experiences and solutions to everyday challenges I encounter in the Azure ecosystem. I aim to provide valuable insights, tutorials, and guides that can help others in their cloud journey. Whether you're an IT professional or someone curious about Azure, I hope this blog serves as a helpful resource.

## The Inspiration

The inspiration for this blog came from my day-to-day experiences. Often, I found myself troubleshooting complex issues, experimenting with new Azure features, and working on intricate projects. Documenting these experiences not only helps me reflect on my work but also provides a platform to help others who might be facing similar challenges.

## What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:
- **Detailed Tutorials and How-To Guides**: Step-by-step instructions on various Azure services and tools.
- **Best Practices and Frameworks**: Insights into frameworks like CAF and WAF, ensuring robust and scalable solutions.
- **Real-World Experiences**: Stories and lessons learned from my projects, providing practical insights.
- **Updates on Azure**: Keeping you informed about the latest features and developments in the Azure ecosystem.

## Building a Community

Beyond sharing knowledge, I aim to build a community where fellow Azure enthusiasts and IT professionals can engage, discuss, and collaborate. Your feedback, questions, and contributions are invaluable to making this blog a vibrant and resourceful space.

## Final Thoughts

Creating this blog has been an incredibly rewarding journey. It's amazing how tools like GitHub Pages and Jekyll can transform a simple idea into a fully functional blog. Stay tuned for more posts where I'll dive deeper into Azure and share my ongoing IT adventures!

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to sharing my knowledge and learning from the community.
