## Introduction

Hello, I'm **Cristian Schmitt Nieto**, a Spanish IT enthusiast who moved to Germany for work. From a young age, I've been passionate about computers, and this passion has driven my career in IT for over 10 years.

## Early Career

I started my professional journey as an apprentice, handling clients, installing printers, and managing basic tasks. However, my career path took a significant turn when I discovered the fascinating world of network infrastructures and servers.

## Professional Experience

After several years managing a small data center, which included firewalls, S2D Clusters, Windows infrastructures, and Citrix, I decided to dive into the realm of Azure.

## Azure Journey

It's been over five years since I embarked on this Azure adventure, and my enthusiasm and motivation have only grown. In this blog, I aim to share my personal experiences in the Azure world, along with the day-to-day challenges and solutions I encounter.

### Areas of Expertise

Throughout the years, I've worked with:

I have guided various clients on their cloud journeys, helping them implement diverse solutions using technologies and frameworks like:
