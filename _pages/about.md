# Introduction

Hello! I'm **Cristian Schmitt Nieto**, originally from Spain, now living in Germany. My passion for technology started at a young age, and over the past decade, I've built a career in IT that I'm truly proud of. This blog is a space where I share my journey, insights, and experiences, particularly focusing on my work with Azure.

# Early Career

My professional journey began in the most basic way possible – handling client support, installing printers, and managing everyday IT tasks. These early experiences were crucial in building my foundational skills. However, it wasn’t long before I discovered my true interest in network infrastructures and servers, which set the course for my future career.

# Professional Experience

## Data Center Management

For several years, I managed a small data center. This role involved a wide range of responsibilities, from maintaining firewalls and S2D clusters to managing Windows infrastructures and Citrix environments. Here are some of the key areas I worked on:

- **Firewalls**: Ensuring security and proper data flow.
- **S2D Clusters**: Managing storage solutions to ensure data availability and reliability.
- **Windows Servers**:
  - **File Servers (DFS)**: Managing distributed file systems.
  - **Active Directory**: Overseeing user and resource management.
  - **DHCP/DNS**: Handling network services.
- **Citrix**: Managing virtual desktops and applications.

# Azure Journey

Five years ago, I decided to specialize in Azure, and it has been a remarkable journey since. My enthusiasm for cloud computing has only grown stronger over time. In this blog, I aim to share my personal experiences, the challenges I face, and the solutions I find in the Azure ecosystem.

## Areas of Expertise

### Hybrid Infrastructures

I have extensive experience with hybrid infrastructures, primarily focusing on Azure Stack HCI and AKS. These technologies bridge the gap between on-premises data centers and the cloud, offering flexibility and scalability.

### Azure Infrastructures

I specialize in various Azure services, with a particular focus on Azure Virtual Desktop and Azure Public Infrastructure. My work involves setting up, managing, and optimizing these environments to meet diverse client needs.

### Client Solutions and Frameworks

Over the years, I've helped numerous clients navigate their cloud journeys, implementing a range of solutions using technologies and frameworks such as:

- **Azure DevOps**: Streamlining development and deployment processes.
- **Terraform**: Automating infrastructure provisioning.
- **Bicep**: Simplifying Azure resource management.
- **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)**: Guiding clients through cloud adoption best practices.
- **Well Architected Framework (WAF)**: Ensuring solutions are scalable, secure, and efficient.
