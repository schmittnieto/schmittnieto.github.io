## Introduction

This personal blog is operated by Cristian Schmitt Nieto. I respect your privacy and handle personal data in line with the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Economic Area, as well as similar rules in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. This policy explains what I collect, why I collect it, how I use it, how long I keep it, and the choices you have.

If you have questions, contact me at [privacy@schmitt-nieto.com](mailto:privacy@schmitt-nieto.com).

## Who is the controller

**Controller**  
Cristian Schmitt Nieto  
Email: [privacy@schmitt-nieto.com](mailto:privacy@schmitt-nieto.com)

## Where and how the site is hosted

This site runs on GitHub Pages. When you visit the site, GitHub may process standard server logs for security and reliability. See the GitHub Privacy Statement for details. I do not control GitHub’s independent processing.

## What I collect

I try to keep data collection to a minimum.

1) **Essential data**  
Basic technical information provided by your browser and device is processed by the hosting platform for security and to deliver the site. This includes IP address, user agent, date and time of request, and requested URL.

2) **Analytics and usage data**  
With your consent, I use Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity to understand how visitors use the site. This can include page views, time on page, navigation paths, scroll depth, interactions, approximate region, device and browser information, and similar metrics. I do not use these tools to identify you directly.

3) **Comments with Disqus**  
By default, blog posts embed Disqus for comments. When the comments widget loads, Disqus may set cookies, read your IP address and user agent, and process interaction data. If you post a comment, Disqus will process any information you submit. Disqus operates as an independent controller for its service.

I do not collect special category data on this site and I do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Cookies and consent

When you first visit, you will see a consent banner. Analytics cookies and similar technologies only load after you choose Accept. If you choose Decline, only essential technologies required to run the site are used.

Starting 31 October 2025, Microsoft Clarity requires an explicit consent signal for visitors in the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland. The site uses Google Consent Mode v2 and the Clarity Consent API to transmit your choice. If you decline, I disable analytics storage and Clarity runs in a restricted mode that does not set analytics cookies.

You can change your choice at any time by using the cookie button shown on the page. You can also manage cookies in your browser settings.

For general information about cookies and management options, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Data: when the widget loads, Disqus may set cookies and receive your IP address, user agent, and page URL. If you comment, Disqus will process the information you submit and may associate it with a Disqus account or social login.  
Important: comments are embedded by default on post pages and cannot be disabled from this site. If you do not want Disqus to load, you can block third party scripts or cookies in your browser or use content blocking tools. Doing so may prevent comments from displaying.  
Legal basis: for loading the widget, legitimate interests in providing an interactive blog and community features. For Disqus own processing, Disqus acts as an independent controller with its own legal bases.
